        <p>
          Entrepreneur, strategic planner, software developer, and civil
          engineer. Imam, educator, and lifelong learner. Ahmad is a highly
          effective and experienced leader with excellent communication skills,
          strong attention to detail and a remarkable ability to patiently
          organize and sort almost anything!

          Ahmad started programming on Sinclair computers in the 1980s. He
          started web-development in the 1990s. He also took some mobile-app
          development courses at the University of California Irvine (UCI)
          extension (online) in 2013 and produced his first app, that was
          published to Apple's App Store, in 2014.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, all of this development was amateurish until he started
          studying coding, professionally, at the University of California,
          Berkeley (UCB), extension (online), in July of 2020.

          Ahmad was born in Egypt and is also a United States citizen. He lives
          in Irvine, California, with his wife and five children.
